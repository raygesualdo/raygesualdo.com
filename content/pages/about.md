Hi there!

My name is Ray Gesualdo. I am a full-stack JavaScript engineer specializing in React, Node.js, functional programming, GraphQL, and serverless paradigms. I enjoy hacking on the latest tech and ~~being lazy~~ automating workflows and processes. I am also passionate about mentoring, education and personal development in the workplace. 

I started [Fresh Ember](https://freshember.com) in 2015 under which I do development and consulting work, and I am actively involved in various other startups.

When I'm not working, you can find me reading good books, watching great movies, geeking out over all things Star Wars, and hanging with my amazing wife.
