Hi there!

My name is Ray Gesualdo. I am a JavaScript programmer and love React.js, Node.js and anything serverless. I enjoy hacking on the latest tech and ~~being lazy~~ automating workflows and processes.

I've been bitten by the entrepreneurial bug and started [Fresh Ember](https://freshember.com) under which I do development and consulting work. I am also actively involved in two other startups which should launch in 2017. I currently 9-to-5 as a front end engineer at [Promio](https://promio.com) where I lead our web application development.

I am passionate about mentoring and educating others and hope to get more involved in the open source community in the near future. This blog is the first small step in that direction.

When I'm not working, you can find me reading good books, watching great movies, geeking out over all things Star Wars, and hanging with my amazing wife.
