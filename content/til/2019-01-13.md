- [Nerves](https://nerves-project.org/) is a project for building embedded apps with Elixir. Might need to utilize my Pi for that at some point.
- Two of my coworkers, [Steve](https://twitter.com/YOOOODAAAA) and [Dan](https://twitter.com/dandresselhaus), are going to be speaking at [Lonestar ElixirConf](https://lonestarelixir.com/2019/) this year!
- [Scenic](https://github.com/boydm/scenic) looks really interesting for building embedded GUIs in Elixir. The [ElixirConf 2018 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QNxLNMq3Uw) from the author is a great starting point and had lots of great tidbits.
