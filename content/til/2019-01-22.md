- Getting XCode working after an in-place Mojave update is a pain. Thank goodness for [StackOverflow and helpful people](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52522565/git-is-not-working-after-macos-mojave-update-xcrun-error-invalid-active-devel).
- There's a new project for ReasonML/OCaml for creating native desktop apps (think Electron for Reason) called [revery](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery). They have a [demo project](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery-quick-start) that I built. Lots of potential there. Can't wait to see what comes of it.
- The TypeScript team published [their roadmap for the first half of 2019](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29288#roadmap-overview). It's been a while since I've evaluated TS. Probably need to look at it again. Seems a lot has changed since v1 and the community support has grown significantly.
