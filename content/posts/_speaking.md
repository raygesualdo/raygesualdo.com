A few months ago, I gave a presentation to a group of coworkers on public speaking. One of the employee resource groups at Salesloft was doing a series for individuals who

Now I am by no means an expert, but I have spoken dozens of times to groups ranging in size from a handful of people to a few thousand. I have learned many lessons in that time, both through experience and via those who are experts in the field. The remainder of this post is an approximate version of that talk in text form.

## Set the Stage

Speaking is a craft. While it is true that some have a more natural proclivity for it, anyone can do it. Like any craft, your public speaking skills can be honed and improved with time and practice. It doesn't matter what personality type you are either. I've heard some misconceptions about public speakers needing to be extroverts or needing to have this personality trait or that. That's false. In fact, one of the most genuine and moving conference talks I ever heard was given by a very introverted individual. And they absolutely nailed it. So regardless of your current skill level or your perceived natural inclination, you can improve your speaking skills. What I'm about to share is a non-exhaustive list of principles and practices that helped me improve. I hope they are helpful to you as well.

I've broken down these out into three sections:

1. You, the Presenter
2. Preparation
3. Presenting

## You

You as the presenter

### 1. Know Yourself

Note:

- Know who you are
- Know how you communicate with others (1:1, small group, large group)

### 2. Be Yourself

Note:

- Can't do stand-up-style comedy in my talks
- A talk about automated knitting machines

### 3. The Thin Line Between Fear And Excitement

Note:

Same chemicals hit our brain for each. It's how our brain frames the experience.

## Preparation

This is intentionally the largest section because I have found that one of the best leading indicators for how successful a presentation goes is how much preparation I put into it.

### 4. Find A Unifying Thread Or Theme

Regardless of the subject matter, there should be one primary idea, a north star, guiding your presentation. Weave that idea through the entire presentation. Make it a part of your visuals, your examples, etc.

### 5. Tell A Story, Preferably Yours

I had two very different social studies teachers in high school. The first had us do worksheets day in and day out, and that was about it. The rote facts would fall out of our brain not long after we had filled out the pages. The second had us furiously copy down notes to begin class, then they would walk through the notes with us as a narrative, weaving the facts together with stories about whatever it was we we currently learning. You can imagine how much more that stuck with us.

Humans thrive on narrative. Stories are how we think, both individually and communally. When

### 6. Understand Your Audience

### 7. Figure Out Your Preparation Process

### 8. Practice, Practice, Practice. Then Practice Some More.

### 9. Observe How Others Do It

## Presenting

With

### 10. Show, Don't Tell

Note:

- We are all multimodal learners
- If you’re doing a talk on a Rubik’s cube, bring one on stage. If you’re talking about customer service best practices, perhaps do a role playing exercise.
- This can be as simple as turning numbers into a graph or words into a picture

### 11. Speak, Don't Read

### 12. Sloooooooow Dooooooooooown

This one is a bit harder to communicate in text, but when I was giving this presentation I said "Slow down" and proceeded to take a full 10 second pause. As a speaker, it felt eternal. But the point was made. As an audience, pauses give us time to think and process through what was just said. Our brains get a chance to breathe. As speakers, providing these breaks at just the right moments is a helpful tool to drive home a thought or idea. Similarly, we need to take our time when speaking. Just like our brains need moments to breathe, they can't ingest information if they're being bombarded with it too quickly.

Note:

- Huge pause
- Example: Frank Dale
