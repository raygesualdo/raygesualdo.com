- Prettier is already improving its [handling of React Hooks](https://prettier.io/blog/2019/01/20/1.16.0.html#improve-the-pattern-used-by-react-hooks-5608-by-j-f1) in v1.16.0. Good to know Prettier will play well with hooks once they're finally released.
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) seems to be an excellent CSS-only framework. The Bootstrap alternative contains 0 JavaScript which makes it extremely light to implement when scaffolding out projects. I'm going to look into using it for my <abbr title="Server-side rendering">SSR</abbr> Phoenix apps.
- I was looking at smaller libraries for HTML components in JavaScript and THERE ARE SO MANY! I'm probably going to check out `lighterhtml` but there are a few good options:
  - [html-template-tag](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-template-tag)
  - [hyperHTML](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperHTML)
  - [lighterhtml](https://github.com/WebReflection/lighterhtml)
  - [lit-html](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html)
  - [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm)
