- [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) is a great solution for reverse-proxying HTTP(S) traffic, but takes a little work to get set up.
- Linux administration is a whole new world. There are plenty of great resources online though.
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) files are amazing! No more having to remember CLI flags to run a container the same way twice.
- Also, the Docker docs have a night mode now.
