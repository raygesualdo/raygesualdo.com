I [wrote a while back](/posts/scaling-myself#2-coding-in-public) about Coding in Public™, internal livestreams I hosted at my previous company, Salesloft. In them, I would share my screen as I worked through interesting problems, allowing time for questions and feedback from anyone on the call. These were invaluable opportunities for me to share my thought process and for others in the org – both managers and individual contributors – to get plugged in to the proof-of-concepts or bleeding-edge code I was typically working on. I'm glad to say the Coding in Public sessions have continued at Salesloft even after I left because the organization found them so impactful. If you're interested in doing something similar, here are some practical lessons I learned preparing and running these livestreams.

## Before the session

Livestreams work better if you do more than just show up as the host. Here's a few ways to prepare before the session.

1. **(Re)set your expectations**

   It's important to remember what these livestreams are for and set your expectations accordingly. These livestreams are not about popularity or ego-stroking. Abandon any grand visions of hundreds of viewers. On my livestreams, I typically had one to three people. This turned out to be a great size. A small group provides an atmosphere where anyone can ask questions or participate in discussion easily.

1. **Time box**

   Both for yourself and for your audience, time box the livestream. I usually set aside two hours, although that could change based on the work I was trying to accomplish. Time boxing both respects everyones time and helps keep the time focused. If there's no designated end to the livestream, it's easy to get pulled off on tangents or to lose focus of the work in front of you.

1. **Communicate**

   Market. Advertise. Let people know it's happening. It's easy to send one email or one Slack message, but those can easily get lost in the shuffle. Communicate regularly about upcoming livestreams to encourage maximum participation. If you run the livestreams on a regular schedule – mine were more ad hoc – share that as well. Don't forget to create a calendar invite as well.

1. **Be prepared**

   Preparation shows respect. Go into the livestream with a plan of what you're going to work on. Don't just fumble through some random work that needs to get done. Livestreams are expensive in terms of people hours, especially if you have multiple people joining you on the livestream. Have a solid understanding of where you're going to go. Many times, I'd have an outline, a tech doc, or a prepared file with code comments outlining what we were going to work on. If you can, try sending that information out beforehand or include it in the calendar invite.

## During the session

Let's talk about how to turn a good livestream into a great one.

1. **Invite participation**

   These livestreams are meant to be collaborative. They're not webinars. We shouldn't be screaming into the void. Bring the audience in. Make sure they know they're encouraged to ask questions and dig in to what you're working through. The back-and-forth with your audience will most likely be the most valuable part of the livestream. This is another reason smaller groups are many times more beneficial.

2. **Provide context**

   Many times, the things I was working on during livestreams I'd been planning for days or weeks – sometimes months. I had an incredible amount of context concerning what I was going to build as well as the underlying problems I was trying to solve. It is crucial to share this context with the audience. Writing code isn't the goal of the livestream. Understanding the problem space and solution is. This is important because it provides a practical setting where the audience gets a window into your brain and the immense thought you've put into the problem already.

3. **Think out loud**

   Speaking of windows into the brain, think out loud as much as you can. Beyond just setting context, talk through why you're making certain decisions. Perhaps walk through why other possible solutions aren't being used. Try to get as much of what's in your brain out for the audience. Our thought processes encode a lot of the "why" behind a decision while our code encodes the "how". That "why" can get lost over time so it's best to share it.

4. **Record the session**

   This may seem obvious, but there were a number of times I forgot to do this. Don't let this add any additional pressure to you though. You don't have to be concerned with doing anything fancy because the livestream is being recorded. The point here is to have a resource that others (or you yourself) can refer back to later. In my experience, the livestreams were launching points for great conversation about other programming topics – patterns and paradigms, specific architectures in our codebase, etc.. Maintaining a record of those conversations is important and compounds in value the more livestreams you host.

## After the session

While the livestream may be over, the value it provides has just begun.

1. **Share the session**

   Provided we recorded the session, share it out to a wider audience. Some people may have wanted to come but couldn't because of scheduling issues. Or maybe a participant wants to refer back to a conversation that was had. Make sure the session is readily accessible to anyone who wants it.

1. **Follow up**

   During the livestream, participants may have questions that can't be addressed immediately. Be sure to follow up with those individuals. The whole point of these livestreams is to spark conversation and you don't want to let those valuable discussions fall through the cracks.

## Keep calm and stream on

If you're even remotely considering doing a livestream like this, I encourage you to do it! In my time doing them, I received continuous feedback on how helpful they were to those who attended. They were great learning experiences for myself as well. I hope these lessons I've shared will help you in your livestreaming journey. Have fun!
