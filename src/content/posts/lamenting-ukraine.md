After the events in Ukraine this week, writing about tech seems so unimportant. My heart is broken hearing the stories coming out of Ukraine, of a people terrorized by acts of war. Families torn apart. Mothers and children walking miles upon miles on foot to escape. I have Ukrainian friends, some stateside with family and friends back home, and others in-country. I can't imagine what they are going through. I don't have words to help them. For what it's worth, I stand with them. And I hope and pray that this war ends soon.
