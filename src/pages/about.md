Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ray Gesualdo. I'm a software engineer based out of Atlanta, Georgia where I live with my wife, our two children, and our dog.

I've been working with the web for over 15 years. In that time, I've had the opportunity to serve in a variety of roles. With those roles has come a variety of work including e-learning content development, LMS systems implementations, medium-scale WordPress multi-site installs and deployments, WordPress custom plugin development, bespoke website development, full-stack JavaScript and Elixir application development, design systems, frontend architecture and framework migration, and developer tooling and enablement.

As a [community-taught](/talks#reconfiguring-our-mindset-from-self-taught-to-community-taught) individual, I am passionate about giving back to the community and seeing others succeed. I am a perennial conference speaker, mentor to early career engineers, and teacher. When I'm not working, I enjoy reading good books, watching great movies and TV shows, geeking out over a variety of geeky things, and spending time with my family.
